	<h1><center><b>BLOCK CHAIN</b></center></h1>
	<h2><center><b>The time has come for blockchain in insurance</b></center></h2>

As an advisory organization and authorized statistical agent, AAIS recognized the potential for emerging technologies to improve the way insurance industry data is collected, managed and reported to regulators. Over the past five years, AAIS invested in a modern infrastructure to support current and future needs of AAIS, its member insurance carriers and regulators. Blockchain technology is the natural evolution in our data management strategy and solves many of the problems with data transfers and reporting for the insurance industry.

The value of blockchain technology lies in its ability to substantially increase the security, transparency and auditability of data shared across the public internet. Not surprisingly, permissionless blockchain networks are not widely used in the business world due to potential data visibility issues and performance concerns that have been uncovered in some network trials. Permissioned blockchain networks, however, provide a viable alternative. They enable network participants to keep their data secure in their own data center, while controlling how it is accessed and shared with higher levels of security.

IBM Blockchain Platform is based upon The Linux Foundationâ€™s open source Hyperledger Fabric, but with a solid management infrastructure around it. That enables customers to get up and running quickly and focus on the network and applications, not blockchain technology. In addition, IBM is recognized as the leading enterprise blockchain provider, working with hundreds of clients across financial services, supply chain, government, retail, media and healthcare. Our partnership with IBM has enabled AAIS to deliver openIDL to our members quickly, leveraging the expertise IBM has to offer, from hosted services to system management, application development and data modeling.
